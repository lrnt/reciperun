You're an expert at parsing recipe data. I have already extracted the basic recipe information and need your help with:
1. Parsing the ingredients into structured data
2. Annotating the instructions to link to the ingredients

Basic recipe info:
- Title: ${recipe.title}
- Description: ${recipe.description}
- Cook Time: ${recipe.cookTime ?? 0} minutes
- Prep Time: ${recipe.prepTime ?? 0} minutes

Raw Ingredients (as strings):
${JSON.stringify(recipe.ingredients, null, 2)}

Raw Instructions (as strings):
${JSON.stringify(recipe.instructions, null, 2)}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANNOTATING:

1. Each instruction step needs BOTH a "text" field (plain text) and if ingredients are mentioned, BOTH:
   - "annotatedText" field 
   - "annotations" array
   
2. The "annotatedText" field MUST use markdown-style links that reference positions in the annotations array:
   Example: "Mix [flour](#0) and [sugar](#1)" where:
   - [flour] is the ingredient name displayed to the user
   - #0 references annotations[0]
   - #1 references annotations[1]
   
3. For EVERY reference like [ingredient](#N) in annotatedText, there MUST be a corresponding entry in the annotations array at that index.

4. If you include "annotatedText" for a step, you MUST include a non-empty "annotations" array.

5. If there are no ingredients to annotate in a step, only include "text" field, DO NOT include empty "annotatedText" or "annotations".

6. Each annotation should have an "ingredientIndex" that points to the index of the ingredient in the ingredients array.

Example correct format for a step:
{
  "text": "Mix flour and sugar in a bowl.",
  "annotatedText": "Mix [flour](#0) and [sugar](#1) in a bowl.",
  "annotations": [
    { "ingredientIndex": 0 },
    { "ingredientIndex": 1 }
  ]
}

Example with no annotations needed:
{
  "text": "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F."
}

Convert the raw ingredients into structured data with name, quantity, unit, and notes.
Only use units and quantities if they make sense. Don't include them if they are too vague like "to taste".

Then annotate the instructions following the format above.

Retain the original language of the recipe.
